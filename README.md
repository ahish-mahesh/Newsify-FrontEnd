## Newsify-FrontEnd

Why have multiple apps for each new source when you can have a single app which combines all the sources in one place. 
Newsify is a news tracker which brings in multiple news feeds all together in a single place. 
The main aim of this project is to provide the user with a personalised news feed which is content specific rather than source specific. 
The user will also have the options to select their desired news feeds so that content from those pages will only be displayed.

## Features

The following are the features of the planned project
<ul>
<li>Login system to provide user specific content.</li>
<li>The user will be asked to choose from the available sections of news.</li>
<li>The user will also have an additional option to select the news networks from which they desire to view the news from.</li>
<li>News from each network will also be available to read separately. For example, The Hindu, Times of India etc.,</li>
<li>The user will also have the option of filtering the news based on location.</li>
</ul>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
